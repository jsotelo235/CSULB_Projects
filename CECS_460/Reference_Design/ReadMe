reference design for TramelBlaze
   * Verilog design instantiating the TramelBlaze
   * Additional logic for function
   * Target Nexys 4 
@ reset no leds
center button returns to reset state
upper button generates interrupt causing a 1 to be shifted through the LEDS

   * Python assembler for translating assembly to machine
   * .tba (Tramel Blaze Assembly) contains assembly file
   * With Python installed, double click assembler to run
   * Output .coe file to build memories
   * Output .sim file for simulation

For use by CSULB students attempting to master the PicoBlaze instruction
set as implemented on the TramelBlaze
